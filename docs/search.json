Guerrero is the Science and Communication Research Associate for the Integrated, Coordinated, Open, and Networked-ICON Science Cooperative at PNNL. He is a watershed ecologist and a science communicator. since 2004, Francisco has been studying land to ocean carbon fluxes in small mountainous river systems. In his parallel role as communicator (since 2014), he has designed and implemented communication infrastructure (workshops, panels, working groups facilitation, etc.) at research-driven organizations from regional to national levels (e.g. universities, state agencies, and national research centers). Currently, Francisco is creating workflows for scientists and knowledge workers to integrate strategic communication tools along the scientific production lifecycle (from ideation to publication)."

He learned R Shiny in order to build the Herbivory Variability Network’s data submission portal ( repository linked here) but has since gained a broader appreciation for the value of Shiny apps in supporting many aspects of data visualization and wrangling. In particular, Nick recently developed a Shiny app to allow non-R users to explore his lterpalettefinder R package without needing to “speak” R ( repository linked here). Nick completed his M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University."

We are excited to have you with us for this training whether you are a veteran R Shiny user or this is your first foray into the world of Shiny! The link to the workshop schedule in Sched (ASM’s scheduling site) is included here.\n\nWe will be demonstrating the fundamentals of R Shiny using RStudio today so we suggest that you download R and download RStudio before the workshop.\n\nIf your RStudio version begins with anything earlier than “2020…”, we recommend updating RStudio (see “About RStudio” in the top menu bar).\nIf your R version begins with anything other than “4…” we recommend you update R.\n\nUpdating RStudio and R ensures that all R packages will behave as expected and we know where any needed RStudio buttons are on your machine if you require assistance.\nAlso, run the following code chunk to guarantee that you have all of the packages that you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Install the librarian package for easy package downloading\ninstall.packages(\"librarian\")\n\n# Use librarian to install the other packages that you need!\nlibrarian::shelf(shiny, htmltools, tidyverse, leaflet, lter/lterdatasampler)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe aim to make this training fun and interactive so please reach out if you have any questions before, during, or after this workshop!

    "text": "The Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) Network has recently created an R package containing example datasets from some of the LTER sites called lterdatasampler. The goal of lterdatasampler is to provide tidy versions of datasets from LTER sites for use in teaching and training contexts (like this workshop!). Eventually this package will contain datasets from each of the 28 extant LTER sites so be sure to check back often for updates as those data are integrated.\nFor this workshop, we’ll be using one of the datasets in this package to give our apps something to work with. Let’s explore that more fully below."
