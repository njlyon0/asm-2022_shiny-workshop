Nick is a member of the Scientific Computing Support Team at NCEAS. He learned R Shiny in order to build the [Herbivory Variability Network](https://herbvar.org/)'s [data submission portal](https://herbvar.shinyapps.io/data_portal_actual/) (<img src="images/github-logo.png" width="2%"/> [repository linked here](https://github.com/HerbVar-Network/Data-Portal)) but has since gained a broader appreciation for the value of Shiny apps in supporting many aspects of data visualization and wrangling. In particular, Nick recently developed a [Shiny app](https://cosima.nceas.ucsb.edu/lterpalettefinder-shiny/) to allow non-R users to explore his `lterpalettefinder` R package without needing to "speak" R (<img src="images/github-logo.png" width="2%"/> [repository linked here](https://github.com/lter/lterpalettefinder-shiny)). Nick completed his M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University.
