watershed,history
1,"100% clearcut over a four-year period from fall 1962 to summer 1966. Skyline yarding was used and no roads were constructed in the gaged portion of the watershed. Slash was burned in October, 1966. Skyline yarding equipment removed timber from the entire 237 acres of the watershed. With this method, the back end of the logs are dragged to a fixed overhead cable, then lifted free of the ground for transport downhill to the landing. No roads were constructed in this watershed. Debris burning in October, 1966 consumed most of the fine logging debris on the slopes and that accumulated in the stream channel. The control watershed is the adjacent WS#2. Gaging stations are about 1.15 km apart. The control is about 63% the area of WS#1. GIS estimated percent harvest: 95.5%"
2,Undisturbed control. Watershed 2 serves as the control for both WS#1 and WS#3. GIS estimated percent harvest: 2.1%
3,"Roads (2.7 km) comprising 6% of the watershed area were built in 1959. In the winter 1962-63, 25% of the watershed area was cut in 3 patches (5.3, 8.1, and 11.3 ha). A high-lead cable yarding system was used. The slash was burned September, 1963. Undisturbed until 1959. Significant debris flows occurred during flood events in Dec 1964 and Feb 1996. Both of these events resulted in the destruction of the gaging station and extended periods (1-1.5 years) of either missing or estimated streamflow data. The control watershed is the adjacent WS#2. Gaging stations are about .95 km apart.The control is about 60% the area of WS#3. GIS estimated percent harvest: 26.3%"
4,The watershed is approximately 25% patch-cut from 1948 to present. GIS estimated percent harvest: 23.1%
6,"Watershed 6 was 100% clearcut in 1974. Logging began in May 1974 and was completed in August 1974. All timber was removed in a clearcut. Logs in 90% of the watershed were yarded uphill by a high-lead cable system; logs in the remaining 10% were yarded by tractor. Logging residue was broadcast burned in the spring of 1975, and the watershed was planted with Douglas-fir seedlings in the spring of 1976. A road (still present and maintained) was contructed through the watershed. WS#6 was replanted with Douglas-fir seedlings in 1976 and has reached canopy closure (2004). WS#6 is adjacent to WS#7 which is adjacent to WS#8 (the control). No significant difference was found among WS 6, 7, 8 basal area pre-treatment. The Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET) is centrally located just below the WS#7 gaging station. GIS estimated percent harvest: 90.9%"
7,"1974: WS7 was shelterwood cut (approximately 60% of basal area was removed, 30 to 40 trees per acre were left as overstory), WS8 was left alone as the control. WS7 was tractor logged above the road and cable logged below the road. Tractor skidding was straight downhill in WS7. 1975: WS7 was broadcast burned just below the road. 1976: District planted all of WS7 in June of 1976. 1984: The rest of the canopy in WS7 was removed. 2001: WS7 was thinned to 14 foot spacing, which leaves about 220 trees per acre. Young Douglas-fir stand was accidently targeted and thinned to 220 trees per acre in 2001. In the summer of 1974, 60% of the total basin area was removed in a shelter- wood cut. Temporary spur roads were constructed into the middle of and down the southwest ridge of the watershed. Logs in the upper 60% of the watershed were yarded by tractor. Skid trails were not preplanned, but tractor operators were instructed for safety reasons to yard downhill. Consequently, soil compaction by tractors was limited to short segments of main skid trails immediately upslope from the upper spur road. Logs in the lower 40% were yarded partially suspended by a skyline cable system. Logging residue was broadcast burned only on the lower half of the watershed in the spring of 1975. WS#7 is adjacent to WS#8 (the control). No significant difference was found among WS 6, 7, 8 basal area pre-treatment. The Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET) is centrally located just below the WS#7 gaging station. GIS estimated percent harvest: 95.7%"
8,"Undisturbed control. WS#8 is the control for WS#6 and WS#7. No significant difference was found among WS 6, 7, 8 basal area pre-treatment. The Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET) is centrally located just below the WS#7 gaging station."
9,Undisturbed control. WS#9 serves as the control for WS#10. WS#9 is located just south of the mouth of Lookout Creek along the Blue River Reservoir.
10,"100% clearcut in 1975. Clearcutting occured during the spring and summer of 1975, and a running skyline system yarded all logs and unmerchantable material >20 cm in diameter or >2.4 meters in length uphill to a single landing. A significant debris flow in Feb 1986 destroyed the gaging station. WS#9 is the control watershed for WS#10 GIS estimated percent harvest: 91.9%"
Mack,"The Mack Creek gaging station (Figure 9.4) is located at the upstream end of the clearcut reach. The gaging station flume creates an abrupt drop of over 2 m-in essence, an artificial waterfall-less than 15 m upstream of XS 101 (Figure 9.4). The elevation and drainage area for this station are 758 m and 5.81 ha (5.81 km2), respectively. Drainage areas at the downstream ends of the old-growth and clearcut reaches, estimated from 30-m DEM, are 5.6 and 5.9 km2, respectively (Table 9.1). Average channel width is approximately 13 m for the old-growth reach and approximately 11 m for the clearcut reach, but the width is quite variable in both reaches. Average channel gradient was estimated from the longitudinal profile survey to be 10.0% for the old-growth reach and 9.6% for the clearcut reach."
