**Welcome to the 2022 All Scientists' Meeting workshop "Shiny Apps for Sharing Science"!** We are excited to have you with us for this training whether you are a veteran R Shiny user or this is your first foray into the world of Shiny! The link to the workshop schedule in Sched (ASM's scheduling site) is included [here](https://2022lterasm.sched.com/event/13kyO/22x053-shiny-app-for-sharing-science).

We will be demonstrating the fundamentals of R Shiny using RStudio today so we suggest that you [download R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) **before the workshop.** If your current RStudio version (see "About RStudio" in the top menubar) begins with anything earlier than "2020...", we recommend updating RStudio. If your R version begins with anything other than "4..." we recommend you [update R](https://www.r-project.org/). These steps ensure that all R packages will behave as expected and we know where any needed RStudio buttons are on your machine if you require assistance.
