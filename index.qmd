**Welcome to the 2022 All Scientists' Meeting workshop "Shiny Apps for Sharing Science"!** We are excited to have you with us for this training whether you are a veteran R Shiny user or this is your first foray into the world of Shiny! The link to the workshop schedule in Sched (ASM's scheduling site) is included [here](https://2022lterasm.sched.com/event/13kyO/22x053-shiny-app-for-sharing-science).

We will be demonstrating the fundamentals of R Shiny using RStudio today so we suggest that you [download R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) **before the workshop.**

- **If your RStudio version begins with anything earlier than "2020..."**, we recommend updating RStudio (see "About RStudio" in the top menu bar).

- **If your R version begins with anything other than "4..."** we recommend you [update R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

Updating RStudio and R ensures that all R packages will behave as expected and we know where any needed RStudio buttons are on your machine if you require assistance.

Also, run the following code chunk to guarantee that you have all of the packages that you need.

:::callout-note
#### 
```{r libraries-home, eval = F}
# Install the librarian package for easy package downloading
install.packages("librarian")

# Use librarian to install the other packages that you need!
librarian::shelf(shiny, htmltools, tidyverse, leaflet, lter/lterdatasampler)
```

### Example Apps

We have also created a handful of standalone scripts that create the apps we have embedded in this workshop website. You can access them via a [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/njlyon0/asm-2022_shiny-workshop-examples) and short descriptions of each app have been included in the [README file at the bottom of that page](https://github.com/njlyon0/asm-2022_shiny-workshop-examples#readme).

Or, if you are not an avid GitHub user (don't worry if that is the case!) You can download all of those example app files by [clicking here](https://github.com/njlyon0/asm-2022_shiny-workshop-examples/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
